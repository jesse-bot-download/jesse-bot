### **2. Getting Started with Jesse Bot**

#### **2.1 Installation 📦**
To get started with Jesse Bot, you need to install it on your machine. The easiest way to install it is by using Python’s package manager, `pip`.

```bash
pip install jesse
```

Once installed, you can initialize a new Jesse project with the following command:

```bash
jesse init my_strategy
```

This will create a new project directory with all the required files to start developing your trading strategy.

#### **2.2 Setting Up Exchanges 🔑**
To start trading, you will need to configure your exchange accounts with API keys. You can obtain API keys from the exchanges you wish to trade on (e.g., Binance, Kraken, etc.). After that, set up your API keys in the configuration file so that Jesse Bot can communicate with the exchanges.

Example configuration for Binance:

```json
{
  "binance": {
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "secret_key": "your_secret_key"
  }
}
```

#### **2.3 Creating Your Strategy 📈**
Jesse Bot allows you to write custom trading strategies in Python. You can define the entry and exit conditions for your trades based on technical indicators, such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and others.

For example, here is a simple strategy that buys when the price is above the moving average:

```python
from jesse import Strategy
import talib

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def should_long(self):
        return self.candles.close > talib.SMA(self.candles.close, timeperiod=50)

    def should_exit(self):
        return self.candles.close < talib.SMA(self.candles.close, timeperiod=50)
```

#### **2.4 Backtesting 🧑‍💻**
After creating your strategy, you can backtest it using historical data. This will help you evaluate its performance and optimize it for better results.

To backtest the strategy, run:

```bash
jesse backtest MyStrategy --start-date 2020-01-01 --end-date 2021-01-01
```

This will test your strategy between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, and provide performance metrics.

#### **2.5 Deploying for Live Trading 🚀**
Once your strategy is tested and you are satisfied with the results, you can deploy it for live trading. Make sure to use risk management tools like stop-loss and take-profit to protect your portfolio.

To start live trading, use the following command:
